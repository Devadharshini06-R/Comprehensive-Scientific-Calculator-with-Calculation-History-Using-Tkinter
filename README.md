# Comprehensive-Scientific-Calculator-with-Calculation-History-Using-Tkinter
#### Operation of the Program: History-enabled Advanced Scientific Calculator
---
It is a Tkinter-enabled calculator written in Python that enables performing different mathematical functions, such as basic arithmetic operations, trigonometric functions, logarithms, exponentials, and power function calculations. Apart from these basic functions, it also maintains the history of all calculations and also has an option to view as well as remove the history.

### Features of the Calculator:
------
- Basic Arithmetic: Addition (+), Subtraction (-), Multiplication (*), and Division (/).

- Exponentiation & Modulus: Allows exponentiation (^) and modulus (mod).

- Trigonometric Functions: Finds sin, cos, and tan values.

- Logarithmic & Exponential Functions: Has log, sqrt (square root), and exp (exponential).

- Constants Support: Has pi and e (Euler's number).

### Calculation History:
---

- Remembers previously performed calculations.

- Offers a distinct history window for examination.

- Users may clear the history.

## How the Program Works:

### User Input Handling:
----

- Users type expressions into an entry field.

- A button click adds the corresponding value to the input field.

### Evaluating Expressions (= button):
---
- Maps exponentiation (^) to Python's **.

- Executes eval() to calculate the result.

- Displays the result and adds it to history.

- Handling Special Functions (sin, cos, log, etc.):

- Parses the number typed in the input field.

- Executes Python's math module to calculate the function.

- Displays the result and stores it to history.

### History Management:
---

- Clicking History launches an additional window showing calculations previously made.

- Clear history by users with the Clear History button.

### Instructions for Use:
---
- Type in an expression in the input field or utilize calculator buttons.

- Click = to calculate the result.

- Click C to erase the input field.

- Use sin, cos, tan, log, sqrt, etc., to perform scientific operations.

- Click History to see previous results.

- Click Clear History to clear the stored history.
